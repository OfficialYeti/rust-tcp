## Introduction, Overview:

### Basic structure:

Each compter that can communicate using internet technology has such a logical structure.
```

         ----------------------o---------
             Ethernet Cable

"o" is the transceiver
"*" is the IP address
"@" is the Ethernet address aka MAC
```

Units of data:
 - Ethernet: Ethernet frame
 - Ethernet driver <-> IP module: IP packet
 - IP module <-> UDP/TCP module: UDP datagram/TCP segment
 - Network application: Application message

### Flow of data:

Sample stack:
 - FTP: FTP/TCP/IP/ENET
 - SNMP: SNMP/UDP/IP/ENET

The TCP module, UDP module, and the Ethernet driver are n-to-1 multiplexers. As multiplexers they switch many inputs to one output. They are also 1-to-n de-multiplexers. As de-multiplexers they switch one input to many outputs according to the type field in the protocol header.

The upwards flow of data is specified by headers:
 - ARP or IP: type field in the Ethernet frame
 - TCP or UDP: protocol field in the IP header
 - Application: port field in TCP/UDP header

The downwards flow of data for single network interface is simple, becouse there is only one path through modules.

### Multiple Network Interfaces:

Computer has 2 Ethernet addresses and 2 IP addresses.

Data can arrive on any network interface and be sent out on any other.
It is called "forwarding" IP packet: (packet never touches tcp/udp)
```
                           TCP      UDP
                             \      /

                          |    ---     |
                          |   /   \    |
                          |  /     v   |
                          --------------
                           /         \
                          /           \
                       data           data
                      comes in         goes out
                     here               here
```

IP hides the underlying network hardware from the nework applications.

## Ethernet:

### Ethernet frame:

| Destination Addr | Source Addr | Type  |  Data  | Frame check seq |
| :--------------: | :---------: | :---: | :----: | :-------------: |
|        6B        |     6B      |  2B   | <1500B |       4B        |

All devices LISTEN on frames that that has destination address equals their address or "broadcast address" - "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF"

### CSMA\CD:

Ethernet uses CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense and Multiple Access with Collision Detection).  CSMA/CD means that all devices communicate on a single medium, that only one can transmit at a time, and that they can all receive simultaneously.  If 2 devices try to transmit at the same instant, the transmit collision is detected, and both devices wait a random (but short) period before trying to transmit again.

### Ethernet as dark room:

1. Each person can hear the words when another is talking (Carrier Sense).
2. Everyone in the room has equal capability to talk (Multiple Access)
3. If two people start speaking at the same instant, each of them know this because each hears something they haven't said (Collision Detection)
4. Each person has an unique name (unique Ethernet address) - "Hello Jane, this is Jack, ..blah blah blah..."
5. If the sender wants to talk to everyone he yells (broadcast address) "Hello Everyone, this is Jack, ..blah blah blah..."

## ARP

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to translate IP addresses to Ethernet addresses.  The translation is done only for outgoing IP packets, because this is when the IP header and the Ethernet header are created.

```
                  ------------------------------------
                  |IP address       Ethernet address |
                  ------------------------------------
                  |223.1.2.1        08-00-39-00-2F-C3|
                  |223.1.2.3        08-00-5A-21-A7-22|
                  |223.1.2.4        08-00-10-99-AC-54|
                  ------------------------------------
                      TABLE 1.  Example ARP Table

```

If ARP Table does not have some IP address:
1. An ARP request packet with a broadcast Ethernet address is sent
        out on the network to every computer.
2. The outgoing IP packet is queued.
3. The ARP response arrives with the IP-to-Ethernet address
        translation for the ARP table.
4. For the queued IP packet, the ARP table is used to translate the
        IP address to the Ethernet address.
5. The Ethernet frame is transmitted on the Ethernet.

If the target computer does not exist, there will be no ARP response and no entry in the ARP table.  IP will discard outgoing IP packets sent to that address.  The upper layer protocols can't tell the difference between a broken Ethernet and the absence of a computer with the target IP address.

## Internet Protocol

### Routing Overview

IP uses in-memory table to make all decisions about routing an IP packet. The content of the route table is defined by the network administrator. Mistakes block communication.

The Direct Routing:
```
                          A      B      C
                          |      |      |
                        --o------o------o--
                        Ethernet 1
                        IP network "development"

                       Figure 6.  One IP Network

                ----------------------------------------
                |address            source  destination|
                ----------------------------------------
                |IP header          A       B          |
                |Ethernet header    A       B          |
                ----------------------------------------
       TABLE 5.  Addresses in an Ethernet frame for an IP packet
                              from A to B
```

For this simple case, IP is overhead because the IP adds little to the service offered by Ethernet.

The Indirect Routing
```
          A      B      C      ----D----      E      F      G
          |      |      |      |   |   |      |      |      |
        --o------o------o------o-  |  -o------o------o------o--
        Ethernet 1                 |  Ethernet 2
        IP network "development"   |  IP network "accounting"
                                   |
                                   |
                                   |     H      I      J
                                   |     |      |      |
                                 --o-----o------o------o--
                                  Ethernet 3
                                  IP network "factory"

               Figure 7.  Three IP Networks; One internet

```

It is composed of 3 Ethernets and 3 IP networks connected by an IP-router called computer D. Each IP network has 4 computers; each computer has its own IP address and Ethernet address.

Computer D is the IP-router; it is connected to all 3 networks and therefore has 3 IP addresses and 3 Ethernet addresses. Computer D has a TCP/IP protocol stack similar to that in Figure 3, except that it has 3 ARP modules and 3 Ethernet drivers instead of 2. Please note that computer D has only one IP module.

Indirect Communication means across diffrent networks. For example: 

A -> E

1. Send IP Packet to router ethernet address, but with E's IP
```
                ----------------------------------------
                |address            source  destination|
                ----------------------------------------
                |IP header          A       E          |
                |Ethernet header    A       D          |
                ----------------------------------------
       TABLE 6.  Addresses in an Ethernet frame for an IP packet
                         from A to E (before D)
```
2. D's IP module receives the IP packet and upon examining the destination IP address, says "This is not my IP address," and sends the IP packet directly to E.
```
                ----------------------------------------
                |address            source  destination|
                ----------------------------------------
                |IP header          A       E          |
                |Ethernet header    D       E          |
                ----------------------------------------
       TABLE 7.  Addresses in an Ethernet frame for an IP packet
                         from A to E (after D)
```

### IP Module Roules

For outgoing packet IP must decide whether to send the IP packet directly or indirectly, and IP must choose a lower network interface. These choices are made by consulting the route table.

For incoming packet IP must decide whether to forward the IP packet or pass it to an upper layer
When an incomong IP packet arrives it is never forwarded back out through the same network interface.

These decisions are made before the IP packet is handed to the lower interface and before the ARP table is consulted

### IP Route Table

The primary columns in the route table are:  
 - IP network number, 
 - direct/indirect flag, 
 - router IP address, 
 - and interface number.  
 
 This table is referred to by IP for each outgoing IP packet.

Show route table with 
 - route print 
 - netstat -r

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                TABLE 9.  Example Simple Route Table with Numbers
```

Alpha is sending an IP packet to beta:
 1. The IP packet is in alpha's IP module
 2. Destination IP address is beta - 223.1.2.2
 3. IP module scans first column of route table for a match network - 223.1.2.2
 4. Frame is sent directly to beta via interface number 1.

 If an application tries to send data to an I{ that is not on the development network, IP will be unable to find a match in the route table. IP then discards the IP packet.

```

Alpha is sending an IP Packet to Epsilon
 1. The IP packet is in alpha's IP module
 2. Destination IP Address is Epsilion 223.1.3.2
 3. Scanning IP Routing table for 223.1.3
 4. The table says that destination network can be reached by router 223.1.2.4
 5. Alpha's perform ARP request for 223.1.2.4 Ethernet Address (MAC)
 6. Alpha sends to the router: 
 ```
                ----------------------------------------

                ----------------------------------------
```
 7. IP packet arrives to Delta - lookup in delta's routing table for destination network.
```
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |network      direct/indirect flag  router           interface number|
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
              TABLE 13.  Delta's Route Table with Numbers

 8. IP then sends the IP packet directly to epsilon through interface number 3. The IP packet contains the IP destination address of epsilon and the Ethernet destination address of epsilon.
 9. The IP packet arrives at epsilon and is passed up to epsilon's IP module.  The destination IP address is examined and found to match with epsilon's IP address, so the IP packet is passed to the upper protocol layer.

 ## UDP: User Dataram Protocol

Example network applications that use UDP are:  
 - Network File System (NFS) 
 - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
 
 The service is little more than an interface to IP.

UDP is a connectionless datagram delivery service that does not guarantee delivery.  UDP does not maintain an end-to-end connection with the remote UDP module; it merely pushes the datagram out on the net and accepts incoming datagrams off the net.
UDP adds two values to what is provided by IP.  One is the multiplexing of information between applications based on port number.  The other is a checksum to check the integrity of the data.

## Ports

How does a client on one computer reach the server on another?

The path of communication between an application and UDP is through UDP ports.  
These ports are numbered, beginning with zero.  An application that is offering service (the server) waits for messages to come in on a specific port dedicated to that service.  The server waits patiently for any client to request service.
For instance, the SNMP server, called an SNMP agent, always waits on port 161.  There can be only one SNMP agent per computer because there is only one UDP port number 161.  This port number is well known; it is a fixed number, an internet assigned number.  If an SNMP client wants service, it sends its request to port number 161 of UDP on the destination computer.
When an application sends data out through UDP it arrives at the far end as a single unit.  For example, if an application does 5 writes to the UDP port, the application at the far end will do 5 reads from the UDP port.  Also, the size of each write matches the size of each read.
UDP preserves the message boundary defined by the application. It never joins two application messages together, or divides a single application message into parts.

## TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

TCP provides a different service than UDP.  TCP offers a connection- oriented byte stream, instead of a connectionless datagram delivery service.  TCP guarantees delivery, whereas UDP does not.

When the application first starts using TCP, the TCP module on the client's computer and the TCP module on the server's computer start communicating with each other.  These two end-point TCP modules contain state information that defines a virtual circuit.  This virtual circuit consumes resources in both TCP end-points.  The virtual circuit is full duplex; data can go in both directions simultaneously.  The application writes data to the TCP port, the data traverses the network and is read by the application at the far end.

TCP packetizes the byte stream at will; it does not retain the boundaries between writes.  For example, if an application does 5 writes to the TCP port, the application at the far end might do 10 reads to get all the data.  Or it might get all the data with a single read.  There is no correlation between the number and size of writes at one end to the number and size of reads at the other end.

TCP is a sliding window protocol with time-out and retransmits. Outgoing data must be acknowledged by the far-end TCP. Acknowledgements can be piggybacked on data.  Both receiving ends can flow control the far end, thus preventing a buffer overrun.

As with all sliding window protocols, the protocol has a window size. The window size determines the amount of data that can be transmitted before an acknowledgement is required.  For TCP, this amount is not a number of TCP segments but a number of bytes.
