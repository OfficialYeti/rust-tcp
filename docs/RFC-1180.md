## Introduction, Overview:

### Basic structure:

Each compter that can communicate using internet technology has such a logical structure.

"o" is the transceiver
"*" is the IP address
"@" is the Ethernet address aka MAC
```

Units of data:
 - Ethernet: Ethernet frame
 - Ethernet driver <-> IP module: IP packet
 - IP module <-> UDP/TCP module: UDP datagram/TCP segment
 - Network application: Application message

### Flow of data:

Sample stack:
 - FTP: FTP/TCP/IP/ENET
 - SNMP: SNMP/UDP/IP/ENET

The TCP module, UDP module, and the Ethernet driver are n-to-1 multiplexers. As multiplexers they switch many inputs to one output. They are also 1-to-n de-multiplexers. As de-multiplexers they switch one input to many outputs according to the type field in the protocol header.

The upwards flow of data is specified by headers:
 - ARP or IP: type field in the Ethernet frame
 - TCP or UDP: protocol field in the IP header
 - Application: port field in TCP/UDP header

The downwards flow of data for single network interface is simple, becouse there is only one path through modules.

### Multiple Network Interfaces:

Computer has 2 Ethernet addresses and 2 IP addresses.

Data can arrive on any network interface and be sent out on any other.
It is called "forwarding" IP packet: (packet never touches tcp/udp)
```
                           TCP      UDP
                             \      /
                              \    /
                          --------------
                          |     IP     |
                          |            |
                          |    ---     |
                          |   /   \    |
                          |  /     v   |
                          --------------
                           /         \
                          /           \
                       data           data
                      comes in         goes out
                     here               here
```

IP hides the underlying network hardware from the nework applications.

## Ethernet:

### Ethernet frame:

| Destination Addr | Source Addr | Type  |  Data  | Frame check seq |
| :--------------: | :---------: | :---: | :----: | :-------------: |
|        6B        |     6B      |  2B   | <1500B |       4B        |

All devices LISTEN on frames that that has destination address equals their address or "broadcast address" - "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF"

### CSMA\CD:

Ethernet uses CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense and Multiple Access with Collision Detection).  CSMA/CD means that all devices communicate on a single medium, that only one can transmit at a time, and that they can all receive simultaneously.  If 2 devices try to transmit at the same instant, the transmit collision is detected, and both devices wait a random (but short) period before trying to transmit again.

### Ethernet as dark room:

1. Each person can hear the words when another is talking (Carrier Sense).
2. Everyone in the room has equal capability to talk (Multiple Access)
3. If two people start speaking at the same instant, each of them know this because each hears something they haven't said (Collision Detection)
4. Each person has an unique name (unique Ethernet address) - "Hello Jane, this is Jack, ..blah blah blah..."
5. If the sender wants to talk to everyone he yells (broadcast address) "Hello Everyone, this is Jack, ..blah blah blah..."
